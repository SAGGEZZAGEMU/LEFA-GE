<img src="web_Help_Res/Troll Face.ico" width="35" height="35" />yes, it's another render being developed in this world, and to make matters worse being created with limitations.

the project is being done in another way  ...  

this code is just the beginning/studies/research of what this could be in the future  
the code is totally poorly optimized
## what you need, to build.
the code is being written in | C 90 and C++ 98  
  
#### to compile you need  

 <img src="web_Help_Res/Watcom_mini.png" width="35" height="35" /> Open WATCOM 1.9  
- [<img src="web_Help_Res/windows_icon_aero.png" width="25" height="25" /> open-watcom-c-win32-1.9.exe](http://openwatcom.org/ftp/install/open-watcom-c-win32-1.9.exe)   

    
- <img src="web_Help_Res/icons8-linux-96.png" width="25" height="25" />  [open-watcom-c-linux-1.9](http://openwatcom.org/ftp/install/open-watcom-c-linux-1.9)

#### Install Watcom to linux info.
you need to extract open-watcom-c-linux-1.9 file  
and put his files in a directory called WATCOM  
then you will move this directory to  
/usr/bin  
  
getting like this /usr/bin/WATCOM  

- extract you need a script and define [path to linux.](https://github.com/SILDTeam/LEFA-GE/blob/main/web_Help_Res/LINUX/watcom_config.sh) or put the code in .bashrc


#### Fixe watcom OpenGL Syntax Error!  
put OpenGl Modified / Fixed Files Incluse in [more_files](https://github.com/SILDTeam/LEFA-GE/tree/main/more_files)  
  

####  replace default WATCOM files  
you need to place the files from the MORE FILES directory  inside the Open Watcom installation location  
the default location is C:\WATCOM
